# Exitvote-ceremony

Create one pseudonym for each voter in voterlist:

* Simple Python code for generating pseudonyms
* Encrypt each pseudonym for a dedicated voter
* Export encrypted pseudonyms for delivery
* Provide instructions to participating in a poll
* Do not store connection between voterlist and pseudonyms
* Prove it as well as possible during the ceremony
* Blackbox list of pseudonyms until the end of election
